# Introduction:
*	Data Science is the study of data.
*	It is everywhere e.g., Health care, Banking, Marketing etc.
*	It is used to make predict models

# Why we need Data Science:
*	Data Science solves many problems 
*	E.g., if the weather is not good and that isn’t safe for airlines to fly the airplane and that’s the problem for both airlines and passengers and also there are some routes for airlines which routes they take to fly the plane. So how are these kinds of problems solved?
*	By using some algorithms  of Machine Learning to make some models
*	That’s why we used Data Science.


# BI and Data science:
*	Business Intelligence is a process that analyses the data & delivers information that helps to make better decisions.
*	When concerned is the Source of data, BI is structured like a data warehouse. On the other hand, Data Science is unstructured like customer feedback.
*	BI focuses on past & present data but Data Science focuses on present & future data.

# Prerequisites:
*	Machine Learning
*	Modeling
*	Statistics
*	Coding
*	Databases

# Tools:
*	Data Analysis: SAS/Jupiter, Rstudio, Matlab, Excel
*	Dataware: SQL Hadoop, Apache Spark
*	ML: Spark Mlib Mahout, Azure Ml studio
*	Data Visualization: Jupyter, Tableau, Cognos




# What do data scientists do?
*	Solve the problem
*	Gather raw data
*	Process & analysis of data
*	Meaningful data
*	Visualize the data


# Lifecycle of Projects for Data Science:
*	Understanding the Problem
*	Gather Data 
*	Prepare Data by manipulating and integrating
*	Data Cleaning
*	Model  & Test the Data
*	Communicating Model Result
*	Deploy the Model

# Conclusion:
*	Data Science is a  process of getting information from data by exploring with the help of some analysis techniques and scientific principles.
*	In our life it is everywhere with the help of data science we can solve many problems.
*	With the help of Machine Learning we can make models that give fast  & give accurate work.
*	 Companies makes their  efficient model  by Data science like Fedex.
