# Probability:
*	It is a chance of an event occurring.
*	E.g., Tossing a coin, Rolling a dice, Taking a card from deck.
*	It always lies between 0 to 1. 

# Sample Space & Event:
*	The set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment is called sample space.
*	It is denoted by S
*	Any subset of sample space is called an event.
*	E.g., Tossing a coin 
S={ H, T}
A={H}, B={T}
*	A and B are events and { H, T} are sample points.

# Probability of an event:
*	Probability of an event =  No. of ways an event can occur
                                          total no. of possible outcomes
*	Probability of heads occurring when toss a coin
*	P(H)=1/2=0.5

# Mutually & Not Mutually Exclusive Events:
*	Events that can not happen at the same time are called mutually exclusive events.
*	E.g., Rolling a dice
*	Events that can happen at the same time are called  not mutually exclusive events.
*	E.g., Taking a card from deck

# Additive Rule:
*	If A & B are mutually exclusive events:
*	P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
*	E.g., Rolling a dice 
P(1 or 2)= P(1)+P(2)=1/3 
*	If A & B are not mutually exclusive events:
*	P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)
*	E.g., P(King or Heart) 
P(K or H)= P(K) + P(H) – P(K∩H) = 16/52
# Multiplicative Rules:
*	If A and B are independent events:
*	P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B)
*	E.g., Rolling a dice P(1 and 3)
P(1 )*P(3)=1/36

*	If A and B are dependent events:
*	P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B/A)
*	P(B/A) is conditional probability
*	E.g., P(King and Queen)
P(K)*P(Q/K)=1/2652
