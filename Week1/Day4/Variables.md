# Variables:
*	Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Numbers:
*	 **Integers** are used to represent whole number values. 
*	 E.g
     ```python
       x = 52
      print(x)
     ```
*	**Float data** type is used to represent decimal point values.
*	 E.g
     ```python
       x = 5.2
      print(x)
     ```
*	**Boolean** is used for categorical output since the output is either true or false. 
* E.g
    ```python
       x = 5 > 2
      print(x)
    ```

# Strings:
*	Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quote.
*	E.g.
    ```python
       x = "Python"
      print(x)
    ```
*	Strings are immutable in nature.
# Lists:
*	A list is ordered and changeable, unlike strings. 
*	Lists are very similar to arrays. 
*	They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish.
*	E.g.
   ```python
       x =  [10,20,2.0,30, 'Python']
      print(x)
   ```
