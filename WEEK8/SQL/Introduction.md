# What is Database?
*	A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.
*	You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.
*	The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.
*	There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.
*	There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
*	Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).
*	SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. 
# Relational vs No sql
* Relational databases provide a store of related data tables. These tables have a fixed schema, use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage data, and support ACID guarantees.
*	No-SQL databases refer to high-performance, non-relational data stores.
