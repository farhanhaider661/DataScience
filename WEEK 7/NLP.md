# Natural Language Processing (NLP):
* It is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves communication between humans and machines using natural language rather than coded or byte language.
* It allows you to send instructions to machines in a more simple and efficient method.
* It is useful for personal assistants such as Alexa, by enabling it to understand spoken word and enables an organization to use chatbots for customer support.
* It is easier to perform sentiment analysis.

# Natural Language Understanding(NLU):
* It helps the machine to understand the data. 
* It is used to interpret data to understand the meaning of data to be processed accordingly.
* It solves it by understanding the context, semantic, syntax, intent, and sentiment of the text. 
* **Example:** If you asked: "How's today ?". Now, what if the system answers, "Today is October 1, 2020, and Thursday." Is the system providing you the correct answer? No, Because here, users want to know about the weather.
* Therefore, we use it to learn the text's right meaning of some errors.

# Natural Language Generation(NLG):
* It is a sub-component of Natural language processing that helps in generating the output in a natural language based on the input provided by the user. 
* This component responds to the user in the same language in which the input was provided say the user asks something in English then the system will return the output in English.
* They can predict which words should be generated next (for example, in an email you're writing).
